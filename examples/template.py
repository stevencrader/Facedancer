        # argument, as well.
        #

        # We'll delegate this back to the core handler, here, so it propagates to our subordinate
        # endpoints -- but we don't have to! If we wanted to, we could call functions on the
        # endpoint itself. This is especially useful if we're hooking handle_data_requested(),

        # send something on another endpoint in response to data received.

        # By decorating this function with "vendor_request_handler", we've ensured this
        # function is called to handle vendor request 12. We can also add other arguments to
        # the vendor_request_handler function -- it'll accept a keyword argument for every

        # where the low byte of the index is 3.
        #

        #

        # Another set of convenience decorators exist to refine requests.
        # Decorators like `to_device` or `to_any_endpoint` chain with our
        # request decorators, and are syntax sugar for having an argument like
        # ``recipient=USBRequestRecipient.DEVICE`` in the handler decorator.
        #

        # For out requests, in lieu of a response, we typically want to acknowledge
        # the request. This can be accomplished by calling .acknowledge() or .ack()
        # on the request.
        request.ack()

        # Of course, if we want to let the host know we can't handle a request, we
        # may also choose to stall it. This is as simple as calling request.stall().


    #
    # Note that request handlers can be used on configurations, interfaces, and
    # endpoints as well. For the latter two cases, the decorators `to_this_interface`
    # and `to_this_endpoint` are convenient -- they tell a request to run only if
    # it's directed at that endpoint in particular, as selected by its ``index`` parameter.

# FaceDancer ships with a default main() function that you can use to set up and run
# your device. It ships with some nice features -- including a ``--suggest`` function
# that can suggest pieces of boilerplate code that might be useful in device emulation.
#
# main() will accept either the type of device to emulate, or an device instance.
# It'll also accept asyncio coroutines, in case you want to run things alongside the
# relevant device code. See e.g. `examples/rubber-ducky.py` for an example.
#
main(TemplateDevice)

# Of course, this template looks verbose as heck.
# For an example that's much less verbnose, check out `examples/hackrf-info.py`.
